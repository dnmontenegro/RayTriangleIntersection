# RayTriangleIntersection
Calculating the intersection of a ray and a triangle, and the barycentric coordinates of the intersection point in Python.

Includes implementations of custom 2d vector, 3d vector, 3d matrix, and 3d transformation classes.

Creates images in ppm format of triangles rendered as seen from a defined camera object.

Ray-triangle intersection is used to determine if a point on a triangle is visible to the camera.

Visible points are colored according to the barycentric coordinates of the point.
